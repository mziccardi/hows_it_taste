Project

This application will use the Zomato api and take the users lat and long to call for restaurants that are close to the user. The user will be able to favorite a restaurant and make comments on it that will stay in firebase.

I wanted to build an app that pulls in restaurants that are close to the user and displays some reviews. the user has the ability to favorite a restaurant and see a list of the restaurants they have favorited. the user is able to make notes on a restaurant and these notes display on the note page.
This was a 2 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the zomato API based on their location. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router.

One of the main challenges I ran into was FIREBASE. I used the docs and previous projects as a way to understand hows the technology works, however I ams still confused about databases and how to structure them.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router  and a significant amount of , JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration i'd like the notes to belong to the restaurant. -->
